Lab 5 Writeup
=============

My name: [your name here]

My SUNet ID: [your sunetid here]

This lab took me about [3] hours to do. I [did not] attend the lab session.

Program Structure and Design of the NetworkInterface:

- using queue to store the EA frame before the ARP reply result comes back
- using a structure to store the state route of ARP.

Implementation Challenges:
- [] the state route between local and remote confused me in the code.
- [] the state transfer code don't do well, needed to be improved from now on.
- [] sender and target of ARP frame is needed to exchange.

Remaining Bugs:
[]
